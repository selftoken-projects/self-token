/// @notice Official operators are officially recommended operator contracts.
/// By adding new official operators, we can keep adding new features to
/// an already deployed token contract, which can be viewed as a way to
/// upgrade the contract.
/// Rules of official operators:
/// 1. An official operator must be a contract.
/// 2. An official operator can only be added or removed by the contract owner.
/// 3. Official operators are authorized operators for all token holders by default.
/// 4. A token holder can choose to unauthorize official operators. Then all official
///    operators will not be authorized operators for them. The token holder can still
///    authorize some of the official operators if they want.
